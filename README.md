# SimplyBe Automation

## Description

Task to automate the SimplyBe application using Cypress. ðŸš€

## Installation

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

To set up the project, follow these steps:

#### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abubakarafzal/Simplybe.git
```

#### 2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd SimplyBePractice
```

#### 3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

#### 4. Dependencies

This project uses several dependencies to facilitate development and testing:

- `concurrently`: For running multiple scripts at once.
- `cypress`: Testing framework
- `cypress-parallel`: For running Cypress tests in parallel.
- `prettier`: for code formatting
- `typescript`: Programming Language

## Reporting with Cypress Mochawesome Reporter

Enhance your Cypress test reports with the `cypress-mochawesome-reporter`. Follow these steps to set up and generate beautiful reports:

1. Install the reporter:
    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev cypress-mochawesome-reporter
    ```

2. Update your `cypress.config.ts` to configure the reporter:
    ```javascript
    const { defineConfig } = require('cypress');
    const { addCypressMochawesomeReporter } = require('cypress-mochawesome-reporter');

    module.exports = defineConfig({
      e2e: {
        setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
          addCypressMochawesomeReporter(on, config);
        },
        reporter: 'cypress-mochawesome-reporter',
        reporterOptions: {
          reportDir: 'cypress/reports',
          overwrite: false,
          html: true,
          json: true
        }
      }
    });
    ```

3. To run tests and generate reports:
    ```bash
    npm run cypress:run
    ```

Reports will be automatically generated in the `cypress/reports` directory. ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ

## Scripts

This project includes several scripts that can be run from the command line:

- `npm run cypress:open`: Opens the Cypress GUI for interactive test development.
- `npm run cypress:run`: Runs Cypress tests in a headless Chrome browser, suited for CI environments.
- `npm run prettier`: Formats TypeScript files in the `cypress` directory.
- `npm run cy:parallel`: To run the tests concurrently in parallel, which is ideal for larger test suites.

## Usage

To start the server and open the application, run:

```bash
npm start
```

To format your test scripts to ensure code consistency:

```bash
npm run prettier
```

To run tests interactively:

```bash
npm run cypress:open
```

For automated test execution headless:

```bash
npm run cypress:run
```
